# 📱 QR Code Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates a QR code from a given URL or string and saves it as an image file. QR codes are a convenient way to share information like URLs, contact details, or text that can be scanned by most smartphones.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The script uses the `qrcode` library in Python to create a QR code.
- You can customize the QR code by adjusting parameters like the size, border, and error correction level.
- The generated QR code is saved as an image file (`qrcode.png`) in the current directory.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `qrcode` library: You can install it using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install qrcode[pil]
    ```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the script:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
    cd qr-code-generator
    ```

2. Modify the `data` variable in the script to the URL or text you want to encode as a QR code.

    ```python
    data = "https://www.example.com"
    ```

3. Run the script to generate the QR code:

    ```bash
    python generate_qr_code.py
    ```

4. The QR code image will be saved as `qrcode.png` in the current directory.

## ✨ Features

- Generates QR codes for any URL or string.
- Customizable QR code size, border, and error correction level.
- Outputs the QR code as a PNG image.

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Version**: Adjust the size of the QR code matrix by changing the `version` parameter.
- **Error Correction**: Modify the `error_correction` parameter to set the error correction level (L, M, Q, H).
- **Box Size**: Change the `box_size` parameter to control the size of each box in the QR code.
- **Border**: Adjust the `border` parameter to change the thickness of the border around the QR code.
- **Colors**: Customize the QR code colors using `fill_color` and `back_color` in `qr.make_image()`.
